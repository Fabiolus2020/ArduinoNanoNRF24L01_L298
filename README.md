# ArduinoNanoNRF24L01_L298

Projct#8 & 11

Wireless communication using NRF24L01+ and the L298HdualBridge to control 2 dc motors.

The best results are if you use 9 volt or higher for the remote control. I have set a limit for lowest speed which is 70, the value can be changed to go lower.

There are 3 versions available, all uses same pins so you can have one conntroller using same sketch for version 1,2,3. I wnted different sketches 3 sketches to alternate by simply changing sketch on the tank and the controller stay as is.
